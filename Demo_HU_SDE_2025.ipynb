    "\n",
    "## **What Are Chains in LangChain?**  \n",
    "**Chains** in LangChain are sequences of steps that allow AI models to process inputs **in a structured and modular way**. Instead of calling an LLM directly, **chains** define a **workflow** where multiple components (e.g., prompts, tools, retrieval models) interact to generate an intelligent response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why Use Chains?**  \n",
    "A single LLM call can be useful, but **real-world applications** require **multiple steps** to produce intelligent responses.  \n",
    "Chains help in:  \n",
    "✅ **Breaking down complex tasks** into simpler steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Combining different AI tools** (retrieval, APIs, calculators, etc.).  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Handling multi-step interactions** like question-answering, summarization, and decision-making.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Enhancing modularity and debugging** since each step is independent.  \n",

    "## 6. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation )\n",
    "\n",
    "What is RAG?\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant external information before generating a response. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG fetches real-time, domain-specific data, making AI responses more accurate, factual, and context-aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Do We Prefer RAG?\n",
    "Traditional LLMs (like GPT-4) have limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Static Knowledge – Once trained, they cannot update their knowledge without retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Hallucination Issues – They sometimes generate false or misleading information.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Lack of Context Awareness – They may not have company-specific or real-time information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How RAG Overcomes These Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Real-Time Knowledge Updates – Retrieves the latest data (e.g., from databases, documents, APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Fact-Based Responses – Generates answers only from retrieved documents, reducing hallucination.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Scalability – Works with large amounts of data without retraining the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Customizability – Can be tailored for finance, healthcare, legal, HR, and more."

    "## **Step 3: Converting Text into Embeddings**\n",
    "Now that we have chunks, we need a way to **search them efficiently**. Raw text is not great for searching, so we convert it into **numerical embeddings**.\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/embed.png\" alt=\"Alt text\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What are Embeddings?**\n",
    "  - Embeddings are **vector representations** of text.\n",
    "  - They convert words into **high-dimensional number arrays**.\n",
    "  - Similar meanings get **closer vectors** (e.g., “dog” and “puppy” are near each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why?**\n",
    "  - Traditional keyword search is **limited** (it matches exact words).\n",
    "  - **Embeddings capture meaning**, allowing **semantic search** (understanding intent, not just keywords).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How?**\n",
    "  - We use **pretrained embedding models** (e.g., `openai-embeddings`, `huggingface`).\n",
    "  - These models convert **each chunk** into a numerical representation.\n",
    "  - Later, when a user asks a question, we **compare** the question’s embedding with stored embeddings to find the best match.\n",
